Clone the below sample repository, or you can use any web application that you have

git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started-app.git
cd into the directory
cd todoapp-docker/
Create an empty file with the name Dockerfile
touch Dockerfile

Using the text editor of your choice, paste the below content: Note: Details about the below Dockerfile have already been shared in the video
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN yarn install --production
CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
EXPOSE 3000


Build the docker image using the application code and Dockerfile

docker build -t todoapp-docker .

Verify the image has been created and stored locally using the below command:
docker images

Create a public repository on hub.docker.com and push the image to remote repo
docker login -u dibyenduds
docker tag todoapp-docker:latest username/new-reponame:tagname
docker tag todoapp-docker:latest dibyenduds/test_repo:latest

docker images
docker push username/new-reponame:tagname

To pull the image to another environment, you can use the below command
docker pull username/new-reponame:tagname

To start the docker container, use the below command
docker run -dp 3000:3000 username/new-reponame:tagname
docker run -dp 3000:3000 dibyenduds/test_repo:latest


Verify your app. If you have followed the above steps correctly, your app should be listening on localhost:3000
To enter(exec) into the container, use the below command

docker exec -it containername sh
or
docker exec -it containerid sh

To view docker logs
docker logs containername
or
docker logs containerid

To view the content of Docker container

docker inspect
Cleanup the old docker images from local repo using below command:
docker image rm image-id
